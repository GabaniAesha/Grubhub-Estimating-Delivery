Estimating Delivery Confidence for Grubhub

# Description
Analyzing data from a food delivery service similar to Doordash and Swiggy, specifically Grubhub. The project involves cleaning the data, applying regression and decision tree methods to predict delivery time, and making data-driven recommendations to optimize the delivery process. Goal of the project is to create a reliable prediction system called DelivEASE that estimates delivery confidence for Grubhub, improving delivery accuracy and enhancing the overall customer experience."

"The project utilizes techniques such as descriptive statistics, data visualization, forecasting, regression, and data mining. These techniques helped understand the dataset, identify trends, and predict delivery time based on past data and relevant factors. The expected result was the development of DelivEASE, a prediction system that provides accurate delivery time estimates, ultimately improving client satisfaction and solidifying Grubhub's position as a leading meal delivery platform."
